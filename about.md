Hi I'm Kevin Sherard. I currently employed as a Sr. Software Engineer at HERE Technologies. I enjoy keeping up with latest developments in web technologies and tech in general. This site is just a quick experiment with Jekyll and github pages free hosting, so don't take it too seriously. Have a nice day!
